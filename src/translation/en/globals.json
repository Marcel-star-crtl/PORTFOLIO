  "feedbackText1": "As my first ever experience of a networking, entrepreneurial and educative event. The Push Event 2023 was for me a marvelous one. From getting to know futuristic tools that would help each individuals or enterprise to upgrade their visibility to having to listen from creative minds and already known entrepreneurs and personalities, we never had a moment of intellectual boredom. If you're fortunate enough to participate to the next edition of push event after reading these testimonies i know you won't regret. Whether you go in as a participant, as an exhibitor, the Push event will be a starting point to a great room of opportunities. And don't be afraid to pushü´∏üèæ beyond your imagination.",

  "feedbackText6": "The push 2023 experience was quite a great one. Well, personally I had a great time, primarily because it was the first seminar I 'willfully' attended and also because I met so many people with a wide variety of ideas I didn't know were possible. Had the opportunity to witness A.R (Augmented reality) and V.R (Virtual Reality) incorporated in our day-to-day activities. Played games and tried out produce from exhibitors (P.S: Watched a 3D printer do it's thing). If there is one thing I could say here is that, there are people with innovative ideas out here and Push is here to place the spotlight on them. The more you learn the higher you rise,I can conveniently say, left that seminar on a whole new level, Thanks to 'PUSH'.",
